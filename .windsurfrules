version: 1.0  # .windsurfrules format version

# MCell for web

Web-based Cellular Automata explorer allowing to view, animate, create, and study hundreds of Cellular Automata rules and patterns from over 10 Cellular Automata families.


## Used technologies

- TypeScript
- html
- css


## Project conventions
debug_prefix: QQQQ
standalone: true  # indicates the project should have no runtime dependencies. Local dev modules (like rimraf) are OK.


## File patterns
patterns:
  source:
    - "src/**/*.ts"
    - "!src/**/*.test.ts"
  tests: "src/**/*.test.ts"
  styles: "styles/**/*.css"
  data: 
    - "data/patterns/**/*.txt"
    - "data/rules.txt"
  build: "dist/**/*.js"

# AI Instructions

* If you encounter problems with updating styles.css, just print the planned changes, I will add them manually.

* You are free to add console logs and ask the programmer to check them for you. When adding console logs always prefix them with 'QQQQ' for easier later removal.

* Automatically suggest additions for .windsurfrules that will make future uses of the AI pair programmer more efficient.
