BelZhab              || 23/23/8 || Exploding || Another case of Zhabotinsky reaction.{NL}{NL}Author unknown.
BelZhab Sediment     || 145678/23/8 || Exploding || The rule creates BelZhab like patterns that have growing regions of "sedimentary deposits".{NL}{NL}A rule by Jason Rampe.
Bloomerang           || 234/34678/24 || Expanding || A wave rule that rebounds into a kinder, gentler form of kaleidoscopics - rounded, soft, full, and slow.{NL}{NL}A rule by John Elliott.
Bombers              || 345/24/25 || Chaotic || A close variant of the StarWars rule with much more history steps, what results in beautiful ships, puffers and oscillators.{NL}{NL}Author unknown.
Brain 6              || 6/246/3 || Chaotic || An interesting variation of Brians Brain, with many patterns constructed.{NL}{NL}A rule by Michael Sweney.
Brians Brain         || /2/3 || Chaotic || Brians Brain, unquestionably one of the best known and most beautiful CA rules.{NL}{NL}A rule by Brian Silverman.
Burst                || 0235678/3468/9 || Chaotic || A generations rule related to Nova, Prairie Fire and others which features large areas of cells that slowly die out or decay into oscillators. Named after a characteristic exploding oscillator. Similar to Day&Night in that constructions can be built both with inside and outside oscillations and growth/decay. Has still lifes similar to Life.{NL}{NL}A rule by Michael Sweney.
BurstII              || 235678/3468/9 || Chaotic || Basically it is Burst without the single cell still life. It supports slow and fast spaceships, oscillators, and methuselahs as well as a very characteristic p500+ oscillator.{NL}{NL}A rule by Michael Sweney.
Caterpillars         || 124567/378/4 || Chaotic || The name comes from very commonly occurring caterpillars-like patterns.{NL}{NL}A rule by Mirek Wojtowicz.
Chenille             || 05678/24567/6 || Exploding || {NL}{NL}Author unknown.
Circuit Genesis      || 2345/1234/8 || Expanding || Circuitry which evolves far beyond its programming and continues to do so long after the initial intput have taken the borders elsewhere.{NL}{NL}A rule by Charles A. Rockafellor.
Cooties              || 23/2/8 || Exploding || A very vivacious rule, with cells crawling around like mad lice.{NL}{NL}A rule by Rudy Rucker.
Ebb&Flow             || 012478/36/18 || Exploding || A slow exploding rule with interesting internal dynamics within the growth boundaries. Different types of symmetries will often determine whether a pattern grows indefinitely or dies out. Presents challenging engineering problems. Best viewed with MCell standard/default color palette at speeds of 10 or slower.{NL}{NL}A rule by Michael Sweney.
Ebb&Flow II          || 012468/37/18 || Exploding || A close variant of Ebb&Flow that supports simple gliders.{NL}{NL}A rule by Michael Sweney.
Faders               || 2/2/25 || Exploding || A "genetic" cross between Life and Brians Brain. A dead Faders cell requires exactly 2 firing neighbors to get turned on. A firing Faders cell keeps firing if it has exactly 2 firing neighbors. And when a Faders cell leaves the firing state it goes into a sequence of refractory states.{NL}{NL}A rule by Rudy Rucker and John Walker.
Fireworks            || 2/13/21 || Exploding || Almost perfect fireworks simulation. It produces interesting results from both random and prepared initial states. Even several cells scattered over the lattice will produce long-running ravishing pictures.{NL}{NL}A rule by John Elliott.
FlamingStarbows      || 347/23/8 || Exploding || In this world beautiful expanding diamonds and oddly off-parallelograms sweep across the screen leaving trails of fire and spirals of autogenesis. Reminiscent of a mutant spawn of Faders and mad Zhabotinsky spirals.{NL}{NL}A rule by Charles A. Rockafellor.
Frogs                || 12/34/3 || Chaotic || The name comes from very commonly occurring frog-like gliders.{NL}{NL}A rule by Scott Robert Ladd.
Frozen spirals       || 356/23/6 || Chaotic || The rule features a popular Zhabotinsky reaction, but with one distinction - spirals have icicles in their vertices.{NL}{NL}A rule by Mirek Wojtowicz.
Glisserati           || 035678/245678/7 || Chaotic || From simple seeds this rule is often highly glideriferous, generating striking kaleidoscopic patterns. Sometimes, though, as in the Glidathon orbit, it is more sparse, in the vein of rules such as Transers, but with much longer transients, providing an uncanny sense of "perpetual motion".{NL}{NL}A rule by John Elliott.
Glissergy            || 035678/245678/5 || Chaotic || This rule differs from Glisserati only in its cellsize (5 rather than 7).  As would be expected, this change is an activity booster - so much so, that, unlike Glisserati, this rule has long transients from random as well as simple starts.{NL}{NL}A rule by John Elliott.
Incredible Machines  || 345/2/6 || Exploding || A rule very similar to StarWars, but with greater patterns building potential.{NL}{NL}A rule by Mirek Wojtowicz.
Lava                 || 12345/45678/8 || Expanding || All patterns are very slowly filled with hot lava.{NL}{NL}A rule by Mirek Wojtowicz.
Lines                || 012345/458/3 || Stable || The rule quickly self-organizes into linear structures, with separate orthogonally hatched areas. To see most interesting behaviour seed the universe with a circle with r >= 40 and a density of 20%.{NL}{NL}A rule by Anders Starmark.
LivingOnTheEdge      || 345/3/6 || Chaotic || In this very chaotic rule its hard to tell if patterns will survive or die out.{NL}{NL}A rule by Mirek Wojtowicz.
MeteorGuns           || 01245678/3/8 || Expanding || Almost any design above a certain level of complexity results in a slowly exploding ball of fire which then spits fairly large numbers of generational gliders "meteors".There are easily discovered stable oscillators and static patterns. A truly satisfying environment (if only finding a limited growth meteor gun were as easy...).{NL}{NL}A rule by Charles A. Rockafellor.
Nova                 || 45678/2478/25 || Expanding || Patterns slowly grow. While growing they emit plasma streams.{NL}{NL}A rule by Mirek Wojtowicz.
OrthoGo              || 3/2/4 || Exploding || This simple rule supports spontaneous orthogonally productive "glider colliders". But otherwise it seems fairly quiescent.{NL}{NL}A rule by John Elliott.
Prairie on fire      || 345/34/6 || Exploding || This rule covers the lattice with fire. For best results use yellow-red cells color settings.{NL}{NL}A rule by Mirek Wojtowicz.
RainZha              || 2/23/8 || Exploding || The simplest "Zhabotinsky" style cellular automaton. It spontaneously generates spirals from an initial random pattern.{NL}{NL}A rule by Rudy Rucker and John Walker.
Rake                 || 3467/2678/6 || Exploding || This rule is a simple variation of the Worm rule and is characterized by the numerous rake puffers that it generates. Together with the puffers, it generates many ships and expanding wings. These elements can easily be arranged to collide and form ships and puffers of arbitrary complexity.{NL}{NL}A rule by Brian Prentice.
SediMental           || 45678/25678/4 || Exploding || From a random seed state of 30% ones, the rule tends to form stable "islands", with active coastlines and fascinating inter-island "commerce". But an orbits fate is quite sensitive to the starting percentage. Below 25% or so the world remains sparsely Brain-like, whereas somewhere above 30% the islands begin to accrete into larger "landmasses", so that by 40% you nearly always end up with a single huge "continent". As for simple seeds, they often lead to surprising results. And the rule clearly has great potential from the "engineering" standpoint.{NL}{NL}A rule by John Elliott.
Snake                || 03467/25/6 || Exploding || This rule is a simple variation of the Worm rule. It contains two interesting oscillators, a 3*3 square and a shuttle, among its basic elements. By combining copies of the square, many beautiful oscillators can be generated. The rule also generates many puffers one of which generates a sequence of shuttles. The tail generated by the shuttle puffer resembles a snake.{NL}{NL}A rule by Brian Prentice.
SoftFreeze           || 13458/38/6 || Chaotic || The rule is delicately poised between "solid" and "liquid" phases. From many simple seeds it forms "living crystals" - the crystals form, melt, and reform seemingly indefinitely, in balance with an active phase. The areas of melting can shrink to a point where youre sure everything will freeze over, and then they stage a comeback.{NL}{NL}A rule by John Elliott.
Spirals              || 2/234/5 || Exploding || The rule produces beautiful stable spirals that unroll forever.{NL}{NL}Author unknown.
StarWars             || 345/2/4 || Exploding || A very interesting and beautiful rule producing deep space battle scenes; a paradise for patterns creators.{NL}{NL}A rule by Mirek Wojtowicz.
Sticks               || 3456/2/6 || Exploding || This interesting rule builds a variety of sticks, with ships floating among them.{NL}{NL}A rule by Rudy Rucker.
Swirl                || 23/34/8 || Chaotic || A very twisted universe. Random patterns often create small isolated swirls that rotate forever isolated in the open space.{NL}{NL}A rule by Scott Robert Ladd.
ThrillGrill          || 1234/34/48 || Chaotic || Sparkling dynamics inhabit and rearrange a grill-like background of one-cells.{NL}{NL}A rule by John Elliott.
Transers             || 345/26/5 || Exploding || A beautiful and dynamic rule with many distinctive entities that occur "in the wild", with remarkable inter-entity transformations.{NL}{NL}A rule by John Elliott.
TransersII           || 0345/26/6 || Exploding || {NL}{NL}A rule by Michael Sweney.
Wanderers            || 345/34678/5 || Exploding || A rule very similar to "Prairie on fire", but creates interesting dynamically moving patterns.{NL}{NL}A rule by Mirek Wojtowicz.
Worms                || 3467/25/6 || Exploding || An unpleasant rule producing crowds of disgusting worms.{NL}{NL}A rule by Mirek Wojtowicz.
Xtasy                || 1456/2356/16 || Exploding || From simple seeds in a closed universe this is a lovely kaleidoscopic wave rule that tends to do extended meditations on the letter X.{NL}{NL}A rule by John Elliott.


#Life
2x2                  || 125/36 || Chaotic || Similar in character to Conways Life, but completely different patterns. Many different oscillators occur at random, and a rare glider. This rule is also a 2x2 block universe. This means that patterns consisting entirely of 2x2 blocks, all aligned, will continue to consist of 2x2 blocks.{NL}{NL}Author unknown.
34 Life              || 34/34 || Exploding || One of the first explored alternatives to Conways Life, back in the early 1970s. Computing power was so low back then, it was months before anyone noticed that this is an exploding universe. What makes this universe interesting is the variety of small oscillators and the period-3 orthogonal spaceship.{NL}{NL}Author unknown.
Amoeba               || 1358/357 || Chaotic || An "amoeba" universe - forms large random areas that resemble amoebas. Internal to a random area is chaos. The edge vacillates wildly, and patterns tend to grow more than shrink. The more they grow, the more certain their survival. This is a fairly well-balanced rule.{NL}{NL}Author unknown.
Assimilation         || 4567/345 || Stable || Rule similar to Diamoeba, but much more stable. The diamond-shaped patterns are filled in 70-85% and never die.{NL}{NL}Author unknown.
Coagulations         || 235678/378 || Exploding || Creates gooey coagulations as it expands forever. Best viewed at zoom=1. Notice that this is a close variation of the previous rule, 235678/3678, except that there is one less condition for a dead cell to come to life on the next generation. In general this should make a universe less active, but this is an exception.{NL}{NL}Author unknown.
Conway's Life        || 23/3 || Chaotic || The default rule. This is the most famous cellular automata ever invented. People have been discovering patterns for this rule since around 1970. Large collections are available on the Internet.{NL}{NL}A rule by John Conway.
Coral                || 45678/3 || Exploding || This rule produces patterns with a surprisingly slow rate of expansion and an interesting coral-like texture.{NL}{NL}Author unknown.
Day & Night          || 34678/3678 || Stable || So named because dead cells in fields of live cells act by the same rules as live cells in fields of dead cells. There are obviously other rules, which have this symmetrical property, but this rule was chosen because it has some interesting high period spaceships and oscillators. The properties of the rule were explored by David Bell.{NL}{NL}A rule by Nathan Thompson.
Diamoeba             || 5678/35678 || Chaotic || Creates solid diamond-shaped "amoeba" patterns that are surprisingly unpredictable. For a long time it was not known whether any diamonds expand forever, or if the tendency toward the catastrophic destruction of corners is too strong. Finally in March 1999 David Eppstein found the  c/7 spaceship, and David Bell made a 100% spacefiller out of it. {NL}{NL}A rule by Dean Hickerson.
Flakes               || 012345678/3 || Expanding || The rule produces beautiful flakes, starting from simple groups of cells. Try especially filled circles with radius > 20 cells.{NL}{NL}A rule by Janko Gravner.
Gnarl                || 1/1 || Exploding || A simple rule provided by Kellie Evans. To see its beauty start with simple patterns, for example with a single dot.
HighLife             || 23/36 || Chaotic || This rule is very similar to Conways Life, but it has a surprise replicator pattern. There is no known replicator in Conways Life.{NL}{NL}A rule by Nathan Thompson.
InverseLife          || 34678/0123478/2 || Chaotic || The rule shows similar oscilators and gliders to GOL, but dead cells create the patterns amongst live cells in the background.{NL}{NL}A rule by Jason Rampe.
Long life            || 5/345 || Stable || This rule is called "Long life" because of the extremely high period patterns that can be produced in this universe.{NL}{NL}A rule by Andrew Trevorrow.
Maze                 || 12345/3 || Exploding || An "a-maze-ing" universe - crystallizes into maze-like patterns. Interesting variations: try removing 5 from the "Survival" list. To produce mice running in the maze, add 7 to the "Births" list.{NL}{NL}Author unknown.
Mazectric            || 1234/3 || Exploding || "Mazectric" and "Corrosion of Conformity". An interesting variation of the maze rule which produces longer halls and a highly linear format. Adding B7 to maze (keeping S5) allows some "mice" to run back and forth in the halls. Switching the B3 to B45 though, electrifies the mazes. Dropping S3 gives "Corrosion of Conformity", a slow burn from almost any starting pattern, resulting in a rusting away of the local continuum.{NL}{NL}A rule by Charles A. Rockafellor.
Move                 || 245/368 || Stable || A very calm universe, which nonetheless has a very commonly occurring slow spaceship and a slow puffer.{NL}{NL}Author unknown.
Pseudo life          || 238/357 || Chaotic || In this close variation of Conways Life, the chaos is remarkably similar, but almost none of the engineered patterns work.{NL}{NL}Author unknown.
Replicator           || 1357/1357 || Exploding || In this remarkable universe every pattern is a replicator.{NL}{NL}Author unknown.
Seeds (2)            || /2 || Exploding || Every living cell dies every generation, but most patterns explode anyway. Its a challenge to build new patterns that dont explode. Arguably the simplest challenging rule.{NL}{NL}A rule by Brian Silverman.
Serviettes           || /234 || Exploding || Like /2, every living cell dies every generation. This rule is picked for the exceptional fabric-like beauty of the patterns that it produces.{NL}{NL}Author unknown.
Stains               || 235678/3678 || Stable || Most close variations of these rules expand forever, but this one curiously does not. Why?{NL}{NL}Author unknown.
WalledCities         || 2345/45678 || Stable || The rule creates walled cities of activity. Once the field has stabilized, one can draw lines to connect the cities and the patterns expand to create an even larger city. But once the wall is complete, the city never grows, even though there is near-random activity inside it.{NL}{NL}A rule by David Macfarlane.

Many of the Border patterns are reminiscent of the mathematical objects called "Cantor sets." Strictly speaking, this version has 8 more states than traditional Border would, but it seems to allow easier perception of the overall dynamics.{NL}{NL}Author unknown. Coded in MCell by Charles A Rockafellor
Bricks               || NW5,NN2,NE5,WW2,ME0,EE2,SW5,SS2,SE5,HI3,RS10,RS12,RS14,RS16,RB7,RB13 || Gliding || A very original rule full of small square bricks gliding in all 4 directions. The rule features still life, gliders, puffers, guns.{NL}{NL}A rule by Mirek Wojtowicz.

Large complicated ships can easily be built using combinations of colliding puffers. Several stretchers are also among the basic elements. The small ships can usually be expanded using simple techniques to generate ships of arbitrary width and height.{NL}{NL}A rule by Brian Prentice.

This rule is a very small modification of Conways Life (the upper cell counts as 2), yet the results are dramatically different.{NL}{NL}A rule by Mirek Wojtowicz.
Cloud54              || NW1,NN1,NE9,WW1,ME0,EE9,SW1,SS9,SE9,HI0,RS2,RS3,RS9,RS10,RS19,RS27,RB3,RB10,RB27 || Chaotic || An "L7" rotationally symmetrical weighted rule. The most interesting feature is a period 54 cloud that travels N by NE. Also commonly features hook shaped still lifes and gliders that travel in the NE direction exclusively, some leaving behind a single pixel trail.{NL}{NL}A rule by Ben Schaeffer.
Cloud75              || NW1,NN1,NE9,WW1,ME0,EE9,SW1,SS9,SE9,HI0,RS2,RS3,RS4,RS10,RS11,RS13,RS18,RS21,RS22,RS27,RS29,RS30,RS31,RS36,RS37,RS38,RS39,RS40,RB3,RB10,RB27 || Chaotic || An "L7" rotationally symmetrical weighted rule, variation of cloud54.

Cyclish              || NW0,NN1,NE0,WW1,ME0,EE1,SW0,SS1,SE0,HI7,RS2,RB1,RB2,RB3 || Cyclic || "Cyclish" is so named because of its uncanny resemblance to the "true" Cyclic CA.{NL}{NL}A rule by John Elliott.

Dragon               || NW5,NN1,NE5,WW1,ME0,EE1,SW5,SS1,SE5,HI0,RS1,RS2,RS7,RS8,RS12,RS15,RS18,RS20,RB7,RB11,RB12,RB13,RB20 || Chaotic || A weighted orthogonal rule.

#General binary
Banks                || C0,NN,S3babbabbabba3b,B7ab3aba3b || Chaotic || The rule, also known as Banks Computer, has been proven to be ideal for constructing the logic elements of a virtual computer. The rule discriminates between neighbor configurations. If a 1-cell has exactly two neighbors, and if these neighbors are adjacent to one another rather than opposite one another, the cell goes to 0. A 0-cell with more than two neighbors goes to 1. In all other cases, the cell remains unchanged.{NL}{NL}A rule by Edwin Banks.

All basic types of patterns are supported. The rules potential for generating interesting patterns can be demonstrated by observing the development of any one of the five chaos patterns (C001.mcl through C005.mcl).{NL}{NL}A rule by Brian Prentice, May 2001.
WG Rule012           || WeightedGen,C6,SW0;2;1;1;1;1,PW1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1,RS4;5,RB5 || Chaotic || This rule seems only to support diagonally moving ships and puffers and still life. No regular ships, puffers or oscillators have yet been found. The diagonally moving puffers are very unusual and quite rare. Four such puffers have been found so far, some of which are quite complex (see DP002.mcl). Diagonal moving ships (gliders) with three different speeds have been found including some that travel faster than Lifes glider (see SD001.mcl).{NL}{NL}A rule by Brian Prentice, June 2001.
WG Rule020           || WeightedGen,C6,SW0;2;0;3;0;1,PW1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1,RS5;6;7;8,RB5 || Chaotic || This rule is unusual in that from a random soup it quickly transforms into many small diagonally moving ships. It also supports diagonal puffers.{NL}{NL}A rule by Brian Prentice, June 2001.
WG Rule031           || WeightedGen,C4,SW0;2;1;0,PW1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1,RS5;6;7,RB4 || Chaotic || At first this rule seems not to have much potential but from its simple building blocks really complex puffers and ships can easily be built.{NL}{NL}A rule by Brian Prentice, June 2001.
WG Rule038           || WeightedGen,C5,SW0;3;2;1;0,PW1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1,RS8,RB6;9 || Chaotic || An Irregular rule which is a good example of the unusual nature of the rule family. The guns are particularly interesting.{NL}{NL}A rule by Brian Prentice, June 2001.

Ships with speeds of c/2, c/3 and c/5 have been found.{NL}{NL}A rule by Brian Prentice, June 2001.
WG Rule063           || WeightedGen,C5,SW0;3;1;0;1,PW2;1;2;1;1;2;1;2,RS6;7;9;10;11,RB7;10 || Chaotic || Generates many unusual puffers and ships. Ships with speeds c/2, c/3, 9c/31 and c/5 have been found (see SD002){NL}{NL}A rule by Brian Prentice, June 2001.

The rule does not however, seem to support diagonally moving objects.{NL}{NL}A rule by Brian Prentice, June 2001.
WG Rule072           || WeightedGen,C6,SW0;3;0;1;1;2,PW1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1,RS8;9;10;11;12;13;14;15;16,RB6 || Chaotic || This rule supports a rich assortment of guns and oscillators together with ships, puffers and still life. No diagonally moving patterns have yet been found.{NL}{NL}A rule by Brian Prentice, June 2001.
WG Rule074           || WeightedGen,C5,SW0;2;0;0;1,PW1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1,RS4;5;6;7;8,RB3 || Chaotic || This rule is notable for its diagonal puffers which lay closely packed tiles consisting of oscillators and for the unusual nature of its oscillators and stretchers.{NL}{NL}A rule by Brian Prentice, July 2001.
